# NewHacksProject

- make a browser extension based on the pomodoro technique
- the pomodoro technique has you work for 30 minute intervals, with a 10 minute break in between 

- our browser extension allows access to only productivity websites for 30 minutes, and then unlocks all websites for 10 minutes


- TODO: 
	- add GUI for user to:
	 	- add/remove websites from the productivity site
		- let user know how close they are to breaktime, have ability to hide timer 
		- make override button so they can stop the extension when they are done studying 

	- actually like, make a list of productivity websites 
	- figure out how to lock certain sites (maybe do like, a popup a la chegg?)

- Questions:
	- should apps on the computer be locked as well (i.e. steam, discord?)
